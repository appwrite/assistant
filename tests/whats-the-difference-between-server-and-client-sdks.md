The main difference between Server and Client SDKs in Appwrite lies in their intended use cases and the permissions model they operate under:

### Client SDKs
- **Purpose**: Designed for client-based applications such as web, mobile, or native apps that are used directly by end-users.
- **Permissions**: Client SDKs operate under user permissions. This means they can only access resources if the user has been granted the necessary permissions.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications where end-users will register, log in, and perform actions that require authentication and authorization.

### Server SDKs
- **Purpose**: Intended for backend or server applications like admin apps, CLI tools, or server-side rendered web apps.
- **Permissions**: Server SDKs can bypass user permissions and are constrained by the scope of an API key. This allows server applications to access resources directly, regardless of the permissions set on those resources.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that require more control and flexibility, such as performing administrative tasks or handling sensitive operations that should not be exposed to end-users.

In summary, choose Client SDKs for applications that interact directly with end-users and require user-based permissions. Opt for Server SDKs when building backend services or applications that need broader access to resources without user-specific permissions.
