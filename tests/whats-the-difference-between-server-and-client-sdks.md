The difference between Server and Client SDKs in Appwrite lies in their intended use cases and how they handle authentication and permissions:

1. **Client SDKs**:
   - **Purpose**: Designed for integrating with Appwrite to build client-based applications and websites, such as web, mobile, or native applications used by end-users.
   - **Permissions**: Access to resources is controlled by user permissions. Users must be granted specific permissions to access resources.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications where end-users will register and create accounts.

2. **Server SDKs**:
   - **Purpose**: Designed for integrating with Appwrite to build backend or server applications, such as backend services, admin apps, or CLI tools.
   - **Permissions**: Access is controlled by an API key's scope, which ignores user permissions. This allows for broader access to resources as defined by the API key.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for server-side applications, including Server-side Rendered (SSR) web apps, where the server handles authentication and passes session cookies to the client-side app.

In summary, Client SDKs are user-permission based and are used for client-side applications, while Server SDKs are API key-based and are used for server-side applications.
