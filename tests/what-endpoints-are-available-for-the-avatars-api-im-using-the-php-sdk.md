I don't have the specific details for the PHP SDK, but I can provide you with the general endpoints available for the Avatars API in Appwrite. The Avatars API typically includes the following endpoints:

1. **GET /avatars/credit-card**: Generate a credit card icon.
2. **GET /avatars/browser**: Generate a browser icon.
3. **GET /avatars/flag**: Generate a country flag icon.
4. **GET /avatars/image**: Fetch an image from a URL and crop it to a square.
5. **GET /avatars/initials**: Generate initials from a name.
6. **GET /avatars/qr**: Generate a QR code from a string.

For the PHP SDK, you would use these endpoints through the Avatars service provided by the SDK. You can refer to the Appwrite PHP SDK documentation for specific usage examples.
